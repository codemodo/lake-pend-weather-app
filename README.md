I'm slowly building on this app as a way to teach myself iOS programming.  So far I've managed to:

1) store data in CloudKit by writing a quick OSX tool that reads in data from text files and creates database entries in CloudKit

2) pull data from CloudKit in my iOS app

3) update my UI to be more responsive

Currently working on learning Core Data.
